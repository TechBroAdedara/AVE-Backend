## Project Idea: Attendance Verification by Geolocation
This project aims to improve class attendance systems by leveraging geolocation technology. It replaces the cumbersome manual process of paper attendances with a digital solution where students' presence is verified within a geofence set by administrators. Key features include:  

- Geofencing: 
Ensures students are physically present in the class location to mark attendance.  

- Dual Interfaces:
 An administrator app for setting geofences and class schedules, and a student app for registration and attendance verification.  

- Secure and Foolproof: 
Eliminates cheating risks associated with QR codes or shared codes.  

- Ease of Use: 
Intuitive processes for both students and administrators.  

### Target Audience:
Schools and universities seeking efficient attendance management systems free from at least 85% of fraud.  

### Potential Impact: 
The project substantially improves attendance tracking, reduces reliance on paper, prevents attendance fraud, and fosters accountability, making it invaluable for institutions with large studentÂ populations.
